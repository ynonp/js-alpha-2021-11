# Lab: Hello Vue

[ ] Create a first Vue app in Vite. Change the text to show your name.

[ ] Change the background color to a color you like

[ ] Add a new component that prints `Hello <your name>`. Add it to the page multiple times to see the message repeated.

[ ] Add a new component that shows an image.

[ ] Modify the component that prints `Hello <your name>` so it will take the name as an input property

[ ] Create a component that takes a numeric value and prints the value, one number below it and one number aboe. For example this snippet:

```
<MyNumbers :value="5" />
```

shows the text: `4-5-6`

[ ] What happens if you try to use your component without the `:` i.e.:

```
<MyNumbers value="5" />
```

[ ] Create a component that accepts an array of numbers and prints out the largest value from the array.
