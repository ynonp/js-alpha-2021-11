# Lab: Vue Reactivity

[ ] Add a new numeric field to our Counter component that will determine by how much the counter will increase.


[ ] Write a component that shows 5 text boxes and keeps the text in all the boxes in sync. That is when you change the text in one `<input />` the new value is copied to all the others.


[ ] Write a "Spoiler Alert" component. It accepts text as props, and initially shows only the words "Spoiler Alert". When a user clicks on the spoiler alert the real text is presented.


[ ] Write a component that shows 3 text boxes, first for "seconds", second for "minutes" and the third for "hours". Every time a user changes the value in one of the `<input />`s, the corresponding value should be written in the other boxes. 

For example if we write "1" in "hours" then "seconds" should show 3600 and "minutes" should show 60.


[ ] Create a Vue component that shows a `<textarea></textarea>` and next to it the number of characters written in the text. Number should change as user changes the text.


[ ] Create a component that shows an `<input />`, a `<button></button>` and a `<span />`. When the user clicks on the button, the text from the `input` is copied to the `span`.
